There’s this door on the 10th floor I just
hate so much.
Goddammit!
Do you ever get this door wrong? “pretty
regularly.”
How often? “like 30% of the time.”
Have you seen people misuse it?
All the time. Every day. Constantly.
I hate this door.
Me too Kelsey.
But here’s the thing: as soon as you start
looking for confusing doors. They. Are. EVERYWHERE.
Why?
I feel like Roman Mars would know why.
Roman: This is 99% invisible, and those doors
you hate are called Norman doors.
What’s a norman door?
Roman: Don Norman wrote THE essential book about design. He is the ‘Norman’ of the
‘norman door.’
Alright – and where is this guy?
Roman: ”You Must Go to San Diego”
Okay!
Don: Hi joe!
I’m Don Norman. I’m… gee it’s hard
to describe what i am.
Roman: Well, he’s been a Professor of psychology, professor of cognitive science, professor
of computer science, a vice president of advanced technology at apple. But for our purposes
Don: I was spending a year living in Cambridge, England, and I got so frustrated with my inability
to use the light switches and the water taps and the doors even, that I wrote this book.
If I continually get a door wrong, is it my
fault?
Don: No.
Roman: A norman door is one where the design tells you to do the opposite of what you’re
actually supposed to do, or gives the wrong signal and needs a sign to correct it.
Don: Why is such a simple thing, why does it need an instruction manual? That is, why
do you have to have a sign that says Push
or Pull. Why not make it obvious?
Roman: It can be obvious if it’s designed
right.
Don: There are a couple really basic principles of design, and one of them i’ll call discoverability.
When I look at something, i should be able to discover what operations i can do.
Roman: The principle applies to a whole lot more than doors.
Don: "And it’s amazing with many of our
computer systems today, you can look at it
and there’s no way of knowing what’s possible. Should i tap it once, or twice, or even triple
tap? Discoverability, when it’s not there,
well you don’t know how to use something.”
Roman: Another is feedback.
Don: So many times, there’s no feedback
– you don’t know what happened, or why
it happened.
Roman: And these principles form the basis of how designers and engineers work today:
commonly known as User- or human-centered design.
Don: I decided user was a bit degrading, why not call people people?
It’s amazingly simple, and amazingly seldom practiced.” We call it iterative because
it goes around in a circle. We observe what is happening today, people doing the task.
And from that, we say we have some ideas. Here’s what we propose to do.
Joe: Then you prototype the solution, and
test it.
And  this process has spread all over the world, and is improving lives - from better every
day things like the ones Don wrote about,
to using the process to solve huge problems
in public health in developing countries – water, sanitation, farming, and lots more.
So what’d be a better, human centered door?
Don: An ideal door is one where that as I
walk up to it and walk through it. I’m not
even aware that I had opened a door and shut it. And I don’t have to be aware because
it’s so well designed that it’s just automatic.
So if you had a door which had a flat plate,
what could you do? Nothing. The only thing
you can do is push. So, see? You don’t need
a sign. Flat plate – you push.
Roman: This kind of push bar with the piece
sticking out on one side works well too, so
you can see what side you’re supposed to
push on
Don: Vertical bars could go either way. A
simple little hand thing sort of indicates
pull.
Roman: But we still have terrible, terrible
doors in the world. So many of them.
Don: There are lots of things in life are
fairly standardized. Whether I buy this house
or not is not a function of whether it has
good doors in it. Except for safety reasons,
doors tend not to be improved.
Roman: But the tyranny of bad doors must end.
I think that it’s a really shitty design
the fact that the put A PULL HANDLE when it’s
a push. So it should be a flat panel here.
And not a GODDAMN pull handle. that’s how
i feel about this door. it’s very misleading.
(I agree)
Roman: You’re right becky. You’re goddamned
right. And if we all thought like you, well,
we might just design better world together.
"It won't open because it's a security door!"
"What the **** are you two doing in here?"
Hey, so as you can see, since I started making
this video, they've since changed the door
a little bit. Guess it's a step in the right
direction. Thank you so much for watching
and to 99% invisible, one of my favorite podcasts,
it was so much fun getting to collaborate
with with them. Check them out on any podcast
app or 99pi.org.

There’s this door on the 10th floor I just
hate so much.
Goddammit!
Do you ever get this door wrong? “pretty
regularly.”
How often? “like 30% of the time.”
Have you seen people misuse it?
All the time. Every day. Constantly.
I hate this door.
Me too Kelsey.
But here’s the thing: as soon as you start
looking for confusing doors. They. Are. EVERYWHERE.
Why?
I feel like Roman Mars would know why.
Roman: This is 99% invisible, and those doors
you hate are called Norman doors.
What’s a norman door?
Roman: Don Norman wrote THE essential book about design. He is the ‘Norman’ of the
‘norman door.’
Alright – and where is this guy?
Roman: ”You Must Go to San Diego”
Okay!
Don: Hi joe!
I’m Don Norman. I’m… gee it’s hard
to describe what i am.
Roman: Well, he’s been a Professor of psychology, professor of cognitive science, professor
of computer science, a vice president of advanced technology at apple. But for our purposes
Don: I was spending a year living in Cambridge, England, and I got so frustrated with my inability
to use the light switches and the water taps and the doors even, that I wrote this book.
If I continually get a door wrong, is it my
fault?
Don: No.
Roman: A norman door is one where the design tells you to do the opposite of what you’re
actually supposed to do, or gives the wrong signal and needs a sign to correct it.
Don: Why is such a simple thing, why does it need an instruction manual? That is, why
do you have to have a sign that says Push
or Pull. Why not make it obvious?
Roman: It can be obvious if it’s designed
right.
Don: There are a couple really basic principles of design, and one of them i’ll call discoverability.
When I look at something, i should be able to discover what operations i can do.
Roman: The principle applies to a whole lot more than doors.
Don: "And it’s amazing with many of our
computer systems today, you can look at it
and there’s no way of knowing what’s possible. Should i tap it once, or twice, or even triple
tap? Discoverability, when it’s not there,
well you don’t know how to use something.”
Roman: Another is feedback.
Don: So many times, there’s no feedback
– you don’t know what happened, or why
it happened.
Roman: And these principles form the basis of how designers and engineers work today:
commonly known as User- or human-centered design.
Don: I decided user was a bit degrading, why not call people people?
It’s amazingly simple, and amazingly seldom practiced.” We call it iterative because
it goes around in a circle. We observe what is happening today, people doing the task.
And from that, we say we have some ideas. Here’s what we propose to do.
Joe: Then you prototype the solution, and
test it.
And  this process has spread all over the world, and is improving lives - from better every
day things like the ones Don wrote about,
to using the process to solve huge problems
in public health in developing countries – water, sanitation, farming, and lots more.
So what’d be a better, human centered door?
Don: An ideal door is one where that as I
walk up to it and walk through it. I’m not
even aware that I had opened a door and shut it. And I don’t have to be aware because
it’s so well designed that it’s just automatic.
So if you had a door which had a flat plate,
what could you do? Nothing. The only thing
you can do is push. So, see? You don’t need
a sign. Flat plate – you push.
Roman: This kind of push bar with the piece
sticking out on one side works well too, so
you can see what side you’re supposed to
push on
Don: Vertical bars could go either way. A
simple little hand thing sort of indicates
pull.
Roman: But we still have terrible, terrible
doors in the world. So many of them.
Don: There are lots of things in life are
fairly standardized. Whether I buy this house
or not is not a function of whether it has
good doors in it. Except for safety reasons,
doors tend not to be improved.
Roman: But the tyranny of bad doors must end.
I think that it’s a really shitty design
the fact that the put A PULL HANDLE when it’s
a push. So it should be a flat panel here.
And not a GODDAMN pull handle. that’s how
i feel about this door. it’s very misleading.
(I agree)
Roman: You’re right becky. You’re goddamned
right. And if we all thought like you, well,
we might just design better world together.
"It won't open because it's a security door!"
"What the **** are you two doing in here?"
Hey, so as you can see, since I started making
this video, they've since changed the door
a little bit. Guess it's a step in the right
direction. Thank you so much for watching
and to 99% invisible, one of my favorite podcasts,
it was so much fun getting to collaborate
with with them. Check them out on any podcast
app or 99pi.org.
