1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,890
There’s this door on the 10th floor I just
hate so much.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,798
Goddammit!

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:11,629
Do you ever get this door wrong? “pretty
regularly.”

4
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:12,000
How often? “like 30% of the time.”

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,290
Have you seen people misuse it?

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,869
All the time. Every day. Constantly.

7
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:17,500
I hate this door.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,350
Me too Kelsey.

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:26,320
But here’s the thing: as soon as you start
looking for confusing doors. They. Are. EVERYWHERE.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,390
Why?

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,789
I feel like Roman Mars would know why.

12
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:36,879
Roman: This is 99% invisible, and those doors
you hate are called Norman doors.

13
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,940
What’s a norman door?

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,468
Roman: Don Norman wrote THE essential book about design. He is the ‘Norman’ of the

15
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:44,809
‘norman door.’

16
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,99
Alright – and where is this guy?

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,219
Roman: ”You Must Go to San Diego”

18
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,649
Okay!

19
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,930
Don: Hi joe!

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,969
I’m Don Norman. I’m… gee it’s hard
to describe what i am.

21
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:04,800
Roman: Well, he’s been a Professor of psychology, professor of cognitive science, professor

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,220
of computer science, a vice president of advanced technology at apple. But for our purposes

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,250
Don: I was spending a year living in Cambridge, England, and I got so frustrated with my inability

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:22,970
to use the light switches and the water taps and the doors even, that I wrote this book.

25
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:35,30
If I continually get a door wrong, is it my
fault?

26
00:01:35,30 --> 00:01:38,50
Don: No.

27
00:01:38,50 --> 00:01:43,470
Roman: A norman door is one where the design tells you to do the opposite of what you’re

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,730
actually supposed to do, or gives the wrong signal and needs a sign to correct it.

29
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,930
Don: Why is such a simple thing, why does it need an instruction manual? That is, why

30
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,950
do you have to have a sign that says Push
or Pull. Why not make it obvious?

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,820
Roman: It can be obvious if it’s designed
right.

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:05,470
Don: There are a couple really basic principles of design, and one of them i’ll call discoverability.

33
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,840
When I look at something, i should be able to discover what operations i can do.

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,330
Roman: The principle applies to a whole lot more than doors.

35
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,000
Don: "And it’s amazing with many of our
computer systems today, you can look at it

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and there’s no way of knowing what’s possible. Should i tap it once, or twice, or even triple

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,60
tap? Discoverability, when it’s not there,
well you don’t know how to use something.”

38
00:02:30,60 --> 00:02:32,530
Roman: Another is feedback.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,920
Don: So many times, there’s no feedback
– you don’t know what happened, or why

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,309
it happened.

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,870
Roman: And these principles form the basis of how designers and engineers work today:

42
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,100
commonly known as User- or human-centered design.

43
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,970
Don: I decided user was a bit degrading, why not call people people?

44
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,630
It’s amazingly simple, and amazingly seldom practiced.” We call it iterative because

45
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:03,750
it goes around in a circle. We observe what is happening today, people doing the task.

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,560
And from that, we say we have some ideas. Here’s what we propose to do.

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,890
Joe: Then you prototype the solution, and
test it.

48
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:27,950
And  this process has spread all over the world, and is improving lives - from better every

49
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,69
day things like the ones Don wrote about,
to using the process to solve huge problems

50
00:03:33,69 --> 00:03:38,30
in public health in developing countries – water, sanitation, farming, and lots more.

51
00:03:38,30 --> 00:03:40,940
So what’d be a better, human centered door?

52
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,390
Don: An ideal door is one where that as I
walk up to it and walk through it. I’m not

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,339
even aware that I had opened a door and shut it. And I don’t have to be aware because

54
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,660
it’s so well designed that it’s just automatic.

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,340
So if you had a door which had a flat plate,
what could you do? Nothing. The only thing

56
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,670
you can do is push. So, see? You don’t need
a sign. Flat plate – you push.

57
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,849
Roman: This kind of push bar with the piece
sticking out on one side works well too, so

58
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,950
you can see what side you’re supposed to
push on

59
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,339
Don: Vertical bars could go either way. A
simple little hand thing sort of indicates

60
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,840
pull.

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,540
Roman: But we still have terrible, terrible
doors in the world. So many of them.

62
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,20
Don: There are lots of things in life are
fairly standardized. Whether I buy this house

63
00:04:24,20 --> 00:04:30,510
or not is not a function of whether it has
good doors in it. Except for safety reasons,

64
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,950
doors tend not to be improved.

65
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,990
Roman: But the tyranny of bad doors must end.

66
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,919
I think that it’s a really shitty design
the fact that the put A PULL HANDLE when it’s

67
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,349
a push. So it should be a flat panel here.
And not a GODDAMN pull handle. that’s how

68
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,680
i feel about this door. it’s very misleading.
(I agree)

69
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,150
Roman: You’re right becky. You’re goddamned
right. And if we all thought like you, well,

70
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,219
we might just design better world together.

71
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:07,750
"It won't open because it's a security door!"
"What the **** are you two doing in here?"

72
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,540
Hey, so as you can see, since I started making
this video, they've since changed the door

73
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,570
a little bit. Guess it's a step in the right
direction. Thank you so much for watching

74
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,550
and to 99% invisible, one of my favorite podcasts,
it was so much fun getting to collaborate

75
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,849
with with them. Check them out on any podcast
